# JavaScript-quiz

What a tricky assignement!

- set-up of css file and html were already prepared
-the majority of changes are to be done in JS

## issues and steps
- setting up a step by step process - as this is a bit complicated;
- setting up variables that are related to classes in both htmls as well as the future questions. All of these are placed into questions.js
- logic.js will hopefully stay availble for functions and the process

1. setting up timer interval -this needs to be linked to ending game
2. setting up button event that hides the first page and then displayes the first question
3. the look of the page needs to be amended in JS which can be tricky
    - .setAttribute method
      e.g. -   pTag.setAttribute("style","font-weight: normal; font-size:15px;" );
